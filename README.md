# GFID_descriptors
the Generalized Finite Fourier-based Descriptors is a planar shape descriptor verifying the properties of variance to SE(2), Completeness, Invertibility and Stability which have been introduced in the paper A Fast and Efficient Shape Blending by Stable and Analytically Invertible Finite Descriptors in IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (August 2022)
These descriptors are efficient in Classification, Reconstruction, Registration, Morphing and Data Augmentation.
